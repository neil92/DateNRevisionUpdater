This was a project I created to update the date and revision a particular program was compiled on. It would do this automatically. In case I was in a rush and I forgot to update the version number, I would still know the exact compiled code that was running on the machine.

This is currently a netbeans project.

The directions to configure this to update the date and revision of a  Miscrosoft Visual Studio project come up when you run the program without any inputs.

This was last compiled in Jan 2012.
